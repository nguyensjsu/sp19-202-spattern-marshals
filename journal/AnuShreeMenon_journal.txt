Weekly Scrum Report
Week 1: (4/7 to 4/13)
 * **What tasks did I work on / complete?**
 1. Looked for various games available on the internet and suggested few  games for brainstorming.
 2. Finalized on the "Victory Warriors" which is based on the  concepts of famous series Game of Thrones.
 3. Helped with user-stories and divide them into much simpler scenarios
 4. Discussed the possible design patterns that can be applied to these scenarios
5. Helped on updating the Sprint task sheet and confirmed the mock-up screens.
**XP VALUE**
 I selected "**Simplicity**" and as a part of the XP value and made certain suggestions:
 1. Keeping the requirement simple, clear and short and game play rules (such as scoring, rewards, player lives) so that user enjoys the game and doesn't require lot of thinking. 
2. Added  "design patterns" later after the code structure was finalized. 
 3. Start with  basic user stories and keep the implementation simple so that we can have a basic working prototype. 
 4. Use Green Foot for  implementation and start with small animation to get some idea about how the game is going to look and gain some confidence.
 * **What am I planning to work on next?**
   - Design and implement the "road" terrain of the game 
 * **What tasks are blocked waiting on another team member?**
   - No blockers.
