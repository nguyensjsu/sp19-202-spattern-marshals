## Activity Diagram

## Design
Our Game is built using Green foot engine, We designed our own game and buidd it from scratch. We identified and Implemented below Design patterns.

Composite - For composing and Structuring  all objects in World at proper position.

Command   - For implementing Start and Quit control for game.

Observer  - To notify player activities to aprropriate component like ScoreBoard, HeathBar, Gameover Screen and Level Complete.

Decorator - 

Mediator  - 

Prototype - To clone objects like Enemies, Coins, Lucky charm and moving clouds in the world instead of creating from scratch.

State     -

<h4> Anushree Menon </h4>

<h4> Karthika Arumugam </h4>

Actively suggested multiple Ideas for the game selection, Design, Implemention phases. 

Helped on coming up with requirements discussion and design and user story creation for the game.

Implemented 2 feature stories - Background component for the game, Sound effects for the game.

Implemented the logic of Scrolling background and randomly moving cloud.

Implemented 3 design patterns 

1. Composite pattern -to display and structure the background of the game.
2. Command Pattern - For the Start and Quit buttons of the game.
3. Prototype - For cloning  objects of moving clouds in the world instead of creating from scratch.

Helped in intial integration code from other modules, testing and fixing issues.

As a champion of XP value "Courage" , I encouraged my team to start a game building from a Scratch and also strongly encouraged to implement a game with swording theme insteas of usual bulleting type of game.
